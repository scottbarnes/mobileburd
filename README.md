# MobileBurd

MobileBurd is a small Flask app that uses Bootstrap to translate the main page and trip report content from
https://www.snwburd.com/bob into something that renders better on smart phone.

Visit https://mobileburd.fishcracker.net to see it in action (or just to laugh at it).

To deploy, just run with docker or docker-compose.
